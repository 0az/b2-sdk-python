In the first code block in
doc\source\quick_start.rst

There is a variable overwrite which is not a part of example about how
variable overwrites/namespaces/etc. work and therefore may be misleading
for some users ("So I should initialise and then overwrite?").

I have no recommendation for clearing this up at this moment.

    >>> from b2sdk.v1 import *

    >>> info = InMemoryAccountInfo()  # to store credentials, tokens and cache in memory OR
    >>> info = SqliteAccountInfo()  # to store credentials, tokens and cache in ~/.b2_account_info
    >>> b2_api = B2Api(info)
