In the first code block in
doc\source\quick_start.rst

There is a variable overwrite which is not a part of example about how
variable overwrites/namespaces/etc. work and therefore may be misleading
for some users ("So I should initialise and then overwrite?").

I have no recommendation for clearing this up at this moment.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from b2sdk.v1 import *

    >>> info = InMemoryAccountInfo()  # to store credentials, tokens and cache in memory OR
    >>> info = SqliteAccountInfo()  # to store credentials, tokens and cache in ~/.b2_account_info
    >>> b2_api = B2Api(info)

Does the
# get credentials from from B2 website
pertain to application_key_id only or to all of them? If to more than appplication_key_id, consider pushing it out to a separate line (i.e.:
"""
    >>> # get credentials from from B2 website
    >>> application_key_id = '4a5b6c7d8e9f'
    >>> application_key = '001b8e23c26ff6efb941e237deb182b9599a84bef7'

"""
Is removing corrupted (_how badly_?) corrupted databases a regular
practice? I would opt for a raise exception, creation of a new one
and running some internal or external tool to see if it could be
recovered, instead of deleting it wholesale.
